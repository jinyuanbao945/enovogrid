### Design Movement: Eco-Futurism / Solarpunk
**Core Principles:**
1.  **Symbiosis of Nature & Tech:** Visuals should blend organic shapes with precise engineering lines.
2.  **Optimistic & Clean:** A bright, hopeful tone that suggests a cleaner future.
3.  **Transparency & Data:** Use data visualization elements (charts, grids) as decorative motifs to imply "smart" energy.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Primary:** "Living Green" (Vibrant, life-affirming green, e.g., #10B981) representing nature.
*   **Secondary:** "Clean Tech White" (Pure white, #FFFFFF) for sterility and clarity.
*   **Accent:** "Solar Gold" (#F59E0B) and "Deep Slate" (#1E293B) for engineering reliability.
*   **Intent:** Evoke a feeling of fresh air and high-tech efficiency.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Asymmetric Split:** Split screens where one side is heavy imagery (nature/tech) and the other is clean typography.
*   **Floating Cards:** Content floats on glass-morphism cards over subtle topographical map backgrounds.

**Signature Elements:**
1.  **Topographical Lines:** Subtle background patterns resembling terrain maps or energy flow diagrams.
2.  **Glassmorphism:** Frosted glass effects for navigation and cards to keep the background visible.
3.  **Circular Motifs:** Echoing the logo and the cyclical nature of renewable energy.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Smooth Flow:** Scrolling feels like gliding.
*   **Hover Reveals:** Technical details (KPIs) appear on hover, keeping the initial view clean.

**Animation:**
*   **Parallax:** Background layers (clouds, wind turbines) move at different speeds.
*   **Data Grow:** Charts and numbers count up when scrolled into view.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** *Outfit* or *Space Grotesk* – Geometric, modern, slightly techy.
*   **Body:** *Inter* or *DM Sans* – Highly readable, neutral.

### Design Movement: Industrial Swiss Style
**Core Principles:**
1.  **Grid Precision:** Strict adherence to a modular grid, reflecting engineering rigor.
2.  **Content First:** Minimal decoration; the content (KPIs, case studies) is the hero.
3.  **Bold Contrast:** High contrast between text and background for maximum legibility.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Primary:** "Forest Green" (Deep, serious green, #064E3B) for stability.
*   **Secondary:** "Concrete Grey" (#F1F5F9) for the industrial feel.
*   **Accent:** "Safety Orange" (#EA580C) for calls to action (reminiscent of industrial safety gear).
*   **Intent:** Communicate reliability, heavy engineering capability, and "boots on the ground" reality.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Bento Box Grids:** Information compartmentalized into rectangular blocks.
*   **Sticky Headers/Sidebars:** Navigation remains fixed and prominent.

**Signature Elements:**
1.  **Thick Borders:** Sections divided by visible, thick lines.
2.  **Monospace Data:** KPIs and technical specs displayed in monospace fonts.
3.  **Technical Drawings:** Use of CAD-style wireframes as background textures.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Snap Scroll:** Sections snap into place for a structured reading experience.
*   **Micro-interactions:** Buttons have a solid, mechanical "click" feel (visual state change).

**Animation:**
*   **Slide & Reveal:** Content slides in from behind masks.
*   **Staggered Load:** Grid items load one by one in a strict sequence.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** *Archivo* or *Chakra Petch* – Strong, industrial character.
*   **Body:** *Roboto Mono* (for data) mixed with *Roboto* (for text).

### Design Movement: Organic Modernism
**Core Principles:**
1.  **Fluidity:** Avoid sharp corners; use soft curves and organic shapes.
2.  **Human-Centric:** Focus on the impact of energy on people and communities.
3.  **Warmth:** A departure from cold "tech" looks; inviting and safe.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Primary:** "Sage Green" (Muted, earthy green, #5F8D4E) for calmness.
*   **Secondary:** "Warm Beige" (#FDFCF0) as the canvas.
*   **Accent:** "Earth Brown" (#4A3B32) for text and grounding elements.
*   **Intent:** Position EnovoGrid as a partner that harmonizes with the environment, not just conquers it.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Overlapping Layers:** Images and text boxes overlap loosely, breaking the grid.
*   **Whitespace:** Generous, almost museum-like whitespace.

**Signature Elements:**
1.  **Watercolor Textures:** Subtle watercolor washes (referencing the logo style) in backgrounds.
2.  **Soft Shadows:** Deep, diffuse shadows to create a sense of floating.
3.  **Photography Focus:** Large, immersive photos of real people and landscapes.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Gentle Fade:** Elements fade in slowly.
*   **Cursor Effects:** A custom cursor that interacts with the "water" elements (ripples).

**Animation:**
*   **Morphing Shapes:** Blobs or organic shapes in the background slowly morph.
*   **Image Zoom:** Slow zoom on background images to bring them to life.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** *Playfair Display* or *Lora* – Serif fonts for a touch of elegance and humanity.
*   **Body:** *Lato* – Friendly and round.

## Selected Approach: Eco-Futurism / Solarpunk (Response 1)

**Reasoning:**
EnovoGrid's positioning is "High-Tech" + "Green Energy" + "Global Engineering".
*   **Eco-Futurism** captures the "Advanced Technology" aspect (VSG, EMS, Microgrids) better than Organic Modernism (which might feel too soft/low-tech) or Industrial Swiss (which might feel too old-school/heavy).
*   The "Clean Tech" aesthetic aligns perfectly with the goal of "delivering stable, reliable, standardized products".
*   The color palette (Vibrant Green + Tech White + Dark Slate) matches the user's request for "Green + White/Dark Grey".
*   The use of data visualization as decoration reinforces the "Smart/Digital" aspect of their solutions (SCADA, IoT).

**Design Rules for Implementation:**
1.  **Font:** Use **Outfit** for headings (modern, geometric) and **Inter** for body (clean, legible).
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Primary: Emerald-500 (#10B981) to Emerald-600.
    *   Dark Backgrounds: Slate-900 (#0F172A) for "Tech" sections.
    *   Light Backgrounds: Slate-50 (#F8FAFC) for "General" sections.
3.  **Shapes:** Rounded corners (xl or 2xl) but with thin, crisp borders (1px).
4.  **Visuals:** Combine high-quality photos of energy assets with overlaying "HUD" (Heads-Up Display) style graphics (lines, dots, data points) to simulate the monitoring systems.
